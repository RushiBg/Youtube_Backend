# **Backend for YouTube-Like Platform**  
---
## **🚀 Overview**  
---
This is a full-featured backend for a video hosting platform, built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The project follows industry best practices, incorporating JWT authentication, access & refresh tokens, password hashing (bcrypt), and secure API handling.

The goal of this project is to provide a scalable and efficient backend system similar to YouTube, supporting features like:

- 🔑 **User authentication** (Signup, Login, JWT-based auth)  
- 🎥 **Video management** (Upload, Delete, Stream)  
- 👍 **Like/👎 Dislike system**  
- 💬 **Comments & Replies**  
- 📢 **Subscription system** (Subscribe/Unsubscribe to channels)  
- 🔄 **Token-based authentication** for enhanced security  

## **📚 Tech Stack**  
---
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose  
- **Authentication & Security:** JWT, bcrypt  
- **Other Features:** RESTful APIs, middleware-based request handling
